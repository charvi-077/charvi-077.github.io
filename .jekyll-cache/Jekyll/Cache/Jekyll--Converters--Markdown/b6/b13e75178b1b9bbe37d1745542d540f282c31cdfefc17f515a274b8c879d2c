I"X<p>Last week I spent on stitching up the loose points in the prepared patches of “amend!” commit (<a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/amend-patches/amend-commit-v3.7">workbranch</a>) and finally sent it to the mailing list. After that also started with the second part of project i.e to Implement the “drop!” commit.</p>
