I"\<p>Received reviews on the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210108092345.2178-1-charvi077@gmail.com/">patch series</a> sent last week to Git mailing list and also discussed regarding the implementation of next subtask.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress:</h2>

<p>For the implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit, firstly after going through the Phillip’s patches that implements the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --amend=&lt;commit&gt;</code> I started with looking around the codebase of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">builtin/commit.c</code> and debugging for the variables, functions when we run command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</code> and spotted for the changes to be done in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare_to_commit()</code>. Then I also spent some time learning about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parse-options</code> API.</p>

<p>So, the subtask to be done on the top of Phillip’s patches is to implement the different user interface of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit considering all pros and cons of the available options. And after discussing with the mentors and community on the git mailing list as <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAPSFM5f+cm87N5TO3V+rJvWyrcazybNb_Zu_bJZ+sBH4N4iyow@mail.gmail.com/">here</a>, it’s decided to implement it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=amend/reword:&lt;commit&gt;</code>. Also, one of the major features to select this option is that it supports the backward compatibility as guided by Phillip <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/99b40665-45dd-6c4d-d46a-56c7dbf89568@gmail.com/">here</a>.
Earlier I started playing around and implementing it in different way, on the <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/amend-patches/amend-commit-v1">work branch</a> but now after discussions, I got more clear regarding the implementation and working on it.</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO:</h2>

<p>Still some minor changes are left to be done before sending the v2 of patch series on the mailing list as pushed on the <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/amend-patches/fixup-patch-v2.1">work branch</a>, will complete that. Next, for this week I will continue to work on implementation of the amend!/reword! commit and prepare it’s patch series.</p>

<h4 id="its-the-middle-of-the-internship-and-as-per-project-timelines-i-am-running-late-in-completing-the-first-task-of-implementing-reword-commit-which-could-be-replaced-as-add-amend-and-reword-options-to-the-fixup-commit-but-i-will-speed-up-and-complete-this-task-soon-also-i-am-thankful-for-the-support-from-mentors-and-the-community">It’s the middle of the internship and as per project timelines I am running late in completing the first task of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Implementing reword! commit"</code>, which could be replaced as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Add amend! and reword! options to the fixup! commit"</code>. But I will speed up and complete this task soon. Also, I am thankful for the support from mentors and the community.</h4>

<p>Thanks.</p>
