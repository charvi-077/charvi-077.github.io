I"º<p>Received reviews on the patch series sent last week to Git mailing list and also discussed regarding the implementation of next subtask.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress:</h2>

<p>For the implementation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit, firstly after going through the Phillipâ€™s patches that implements the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --amend=&lt;commit&gt;</code> I started with looking around the codebase of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">builtin/commit.c</code> and debugging for the variables, functions when we run command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</code> and spotted for the changes to be done in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare_to_commit()</code>. Then I also spent some time learning about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parse-options</code> API.</p>

<p>So, the subtask to be done on the top of Phillipâ€™s patches is to implement the different user interface of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit considering all pros and cons of the available options. And after discussing with the mentors and community on the git mailing list as <a href="">here</a>, itâ€™s decided to implement it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=amend/reword=&lt;commit&gt;</code>. Also, one of the major features to select this option is that it supports the backward compatibility as guided by Phillip <a href="">here</a>.
Earlier I started playing around and implementing it in different way, on the <a href="">work branch</a> but now after discussions, I got more clear regarding the implementation and working on it.</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>

<p>Still some minute changes are left to be done before sending the v2 of patch series on the mailing list and pushed on the <a href="">work branch</a>, will complete that. Next, for this week I will work on implementation of the amend!/reword! commit and prepare its patch series.</p>

But I will speed up and complete this task soon. Also, I am thankful for the support from mentors and the community.</h6>

<p>Thanks.</p>
