<p>My Outreachy internship at Git over the past three months was an amazing experience. Thanks to my mentors Christian Couder and Phillip Wood, I learned a lot throughout my internship,  deepened my technical skills in Git, improved problem-solving abilities, and also learned the importance of effective collaboration. I am grateful for the supportive Git community, I look forward to applying these skills in my future endeavors.</p>
