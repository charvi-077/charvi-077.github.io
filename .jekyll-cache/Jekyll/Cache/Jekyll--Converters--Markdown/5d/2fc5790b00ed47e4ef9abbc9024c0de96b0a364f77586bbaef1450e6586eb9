I"8<p>Last week was spent debugging the patch series, solving bug, addressing the code reviews and also doing some corrections in implementation of amend! commit.</p>

<h2 id="progress-">Progress :</h2>
<p>I continued with the implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend! commit</code> <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/amend-patches/amend-commit-v3.1">work-branch</a>. Also I got stuck, as I was unable to track the extra commented lines adding to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend! commit</code> message body. After discussing with mentors I got a way out for this. So the reason was that I was setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">use_editor</code> variable in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare_to_commit()</code> and it gets reset in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parse_and_validate_options()</code> function and then setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cleanup_mode</code> other than the default one. It was a silly bug but I learned to track the bug and liked the way everything is structured in the codebase. Sometimes it gets difficult to track but it’s equally important to write readable and maintainable code and I am learning too. :)</p>

<p>Next, received reviews on the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210119074102.21598-1-charvi077@gmail.com/">v2-Patch series</a>. Got some suggestions on documentation and to add the additional tests for multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -c</code> sequences in interactive rebase, to check if it opens the editor once. And here I will not forget to mention that there was a minor bug in the patch series as it was failing to open the editor for sequence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -c</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code>. Next, other changes suggested in the patch series is to simplify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subject_length()</code> function previously written by Phillip, I learned a way out after discussions and also to do some corrections in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t3415-rebase-autosquash.sh</code> and I also admit that this time I mistook some reviews, maybe unable to think the other way and thanks Christian and Phillip for correcting me. After doing all these changes, sent the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210124170405.30583-1-charvi077@gmail.com/">v3-Patch series</a> to the mailing list.</p>

<h2 id="todo">TODO:</h2>
<p>This week I will continue to complete the patch series of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit. Coming to implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit, some rethinking need to be done for its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User interface</code> as there are two possibilities :</p>
<ol>
  <li>make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</code> and upon autosquash it will change pick command to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code> (not changing to present command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword</code> as we don’t want editor to be opened again)</li>
  <li>make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</code> and upon autosquash it will change pick command to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So here both only reword any previous commit and it implies <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--allow-empty</code>. Any suggestions for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit user interface?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
