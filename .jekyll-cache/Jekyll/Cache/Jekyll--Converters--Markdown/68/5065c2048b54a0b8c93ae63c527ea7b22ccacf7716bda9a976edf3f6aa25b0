I"‘<p>Writing CLEAN CODE - CLEAN PATCHES - that are easily readable and maintainable is also an essential part. So, this week is spent mostly on fixing up the commits, commit messages, making preparatory/clean-up patches and debugging for more changes.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>Following last week, I continued with fixing up the commits that implements the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -c</code> commands. After that, I started with updating the test script and replacing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend</code> command on which we worked earlier, with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code> command. But I got stuck at parsing the multiple word command i.e <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib-rebase.sh</code>. I discussed with Phillip and Christian and got a pointer to make additional case for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">merge</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup</code> options in lib-rebase.sh. Then I debugged the code again and did some changes as two tests were failing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -c</code> and also added a new test case for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -c</code> command.</p>

<p>Next, as guided by Christian I also split some commits and added those changes in the preparatory patches. After that added additional commits and tests for the working of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend!</code> commit upon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--autosquash</code>, following Phillipâ€™s patches.</p>

<p>Then after doing all the changes in the code base, tests and documentation one of the important steps before sending the patches to the mailing list, is to write the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cover letter</code> explaining the reason and use of patches, wrote that and did some changes as guided by Christian and Phillip.</p>

<h4 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://devconnected.com/how-to-create-and-apply-git-patch-files/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git format-patch</code></a>, for preparing patches for email submission and include â€“cover-letter for adding the cover letter.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git send-email</code>, for sending a collection of patches as email instead of pull requests and setting up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gmail</code> as the smtp server as <a href="https://riptutorial.com/git/example/16977/use-git-send-email-with-gmail">here</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://devconnected.com/how-to-create-and-apply-git-patch-files/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git am</code></a>, for applying a series of patches from mailbox and its good practise to test and apply patches locally before sending it to the mailing list.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="patch-series-sent-">Patch series sent :</h2>
<p>Finally the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20210108092345.2178-1-charvi077@gmail.com/T/#t">patch series</a> with RFC sent to the mailing list. And the work branch can be found <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git/commits/amend-patches/fixup-patch-v1">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="todo">Todo</h2>
<p>For the coming week, next task includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debug and look into the code base of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit.c</code>, to find a way out for implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend! commit</code> and discuss on the mailing list regarding the UI.</li>
  <li>Look around the current implementation of Phillipâ€™s patches of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend! commit</code>, which implements it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit --amend=&lt;commit&gt;</code>.</li>
  <li>Work on the reviews and suggestions on the patch series, sent on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>
