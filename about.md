> I am recently graduated from Electronics and Communication, Panjab University, India. I love programming robots and believe in solving real world problems with new technologies. Earlier, I also worked as Robotics Software Intern. I learn and explore new things in my day to day life.


> Currently I am doing [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Internship with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), working on the project "Implement reword! and drop! commits in git interactive rebase". 


> I spend my free time reading books, listening music and exploring nature. Feel free to contact me through my social links.
