> Hi, 

> I am Research Associate at Robotics Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad. I am working on Drone based civil structure assessment under the guidance of [Prof. Harikumar Kandath](https://sites.google.com/view/harikumar-kandath/home) and [Prof. Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla](https://ravika.github.io/). My research areas lies at intersection of Robotics, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. 

> I love programming robots and believe in solving real world problems with new technologies. Previously, I also worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at [Flux Auto](https://fluxauto.xyz/) (2021 - 2023) and [Black Coffee Robotics](https://www.blackcoffeerobotics.com/) (2020). I have experience with the mobile robots and have worked majorly on the SLAM, Navigation and localization algorithms. I learn and explore new things in my day to day life.
 
> I am self-taught programmer, part of open source community and had also successfully completed my [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Internship with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), where I worked on enhancing the git interactive rebase and adding the new feature of amend! and reword! commits to it.

 
> Besides, I spend my free time reading books, listening to music and exploring nature. Also, I would always be happy to meet new people all around. Feel free to contact me through my social links.
