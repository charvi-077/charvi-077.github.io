<p>My first task in the project is to Implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit in the git interactive rebase. This would be an alternative to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup!</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">squash!</code> commit which would allow the user to edit the commit (either commit message or content or both) when they create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reword!</code> commit rather than when they rebase. And for the coming weeks I will be working on this task.</p>

<h3 id="work-done">Work done</h3>
<h4 id="i-started-with-the-following">I started with the following:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up remote repo to push all my changes <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/git">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Completed the My first contribution <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/MyFirstContribution">tutorial</a> which made me more clear about the source code and also referred <a href="https://git.github.io/Hacking-Git/">here</a> for more pointers to get started .</li>
  <li>Setting up this website hosted on <a href="https://github.com/charvi-077/charvi-077.github.io">github</a>, where I will weekly post my updates on the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, Phillip told me about the <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers">sanitizers</a>. I enabled it in my config.mak file and learned about it, so that while building the git repo we can easily detect the address and memory leaks. In addition to this I also enable the warnings and debugging information and my config.mak looks like below :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DEVELOPER = 1
CFLAGS = -ggdb3
SANITIZE = address,leak
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next I spent some time in learning about the advanced linux commands including <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/438882/how-to-use-pipes-on-linux/">pipes in linux</a>, many other and about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git internals</code> from <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf/releases/download/v2.0/peepcode-git.pdf">here</a>. Also, I referred to Pro Git to get more understanding of the git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">Plumbing and Porcelain</a> commands.</p>

<p>Then, after discussing with Christian and Phillip regarding the project and related doubts. Firstly I started with, to have an overview of the Phillip’s <a href="https://github.com/phillipwood/git/commits/wip/rebase-amend">patches</a> which is the starting point of my task as it implements the similar amend! commit.</p>

<p>Then I started learning about the test scripts in the patches and debugged it. All test scripts in the git give the <a href="http://testanything.org">TAP</a> output and there are a set of helper functions defined in the test harness library (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t/test-lib.sh</code>) which are used to write the test scripts . Also, I referred to t/README where everything regarding the test scripts are very well documented.</p>

<h4 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_pause</code> in test scripts to look into the trash directory(which stores temporary data using testing) .</li>
  <li>Pass –verbose(or -v) to see the output if any , –run(or -r) to run the selective tests , -i to exit upon first test fail</li>
  <li>Pass –debug(-d), to run the command passed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_debug</code> in the test script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I learned about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t/lib-rebase.sh</code> where more helper functions are defined, which are used in writing the tests for the interactive rebase and learned about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set_fake_editor()</code> function for setting up the fake editor while writing the test scripts.</p>

<h3 id="next-plans">Next Plans</h3>
<p>I will continue to work on test script, complete tests mentioned in the patches and as guided by Phillip, will look into the code for changing new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amend</code> command in the todo list to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixup -C</code> instead.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
